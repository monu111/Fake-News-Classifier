### Here we have __train.csv__  and __test.csv__ dataset. we have to make a model that can train  the __train.csv__ dataset. and perform the prediction on __test.csv__.






In this repo I use 3 types  model to detect the fake news & performance of all 3 models is given below:

| Tables                | Accuracy(%)   | 
| ----------------------|:-------------:|
| LSTM                  | 92            |
| Bidirectional LSTM    | 92      
| GRU                   | 90            |
